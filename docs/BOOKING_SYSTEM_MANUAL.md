## System Overview

Travel Affordable is an instant quote calculator for South African travel packages. The system allows users to:

- Select destinations (Durban, Cape Town, Sun City, Mpumalanga, Hartbeespoort, Magaliesburg)
- Choose accommodation tiers (Budget, Affordable, Premium)
- Select activity packages
- Generate instant quotes with PDF/Email/WhatsApp sharing
- Book and receive professional invoices

### Key URLs

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Main public booking interface |
| `/rate-admin?admin=true` | Admin rate management (password: `admin123`) |
| `/build-package` | Package builder |
| `/hotelbeds-test` | Hotelbeds API certification testing |
| `/hotelbeds-letter` | Hotelbeds certification letter template |

---

## Hotel Tier Structure

The system uses a **three-tier accommodation structure** with color-coded buttons:

| Tier | Price Range | Button Color | Description |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Budget** | R200 - R1,100/night | 🟢 Green | Basic, value-focused properties |
| **Affordable** | R1,200 - R2,100/night | 🔵 Blue | Mid-range with good amenities |
| **Premium** | R2,200 - R3,100/night | 🟣 Purple | High-end beachfront/luxury properties |

### Tier Data Sources

- **Budget & Premium**: Use real property data with specific hotel names and room configurations
- **Affordable**: Uses placeholder data (e.g., "Durban Affordable Hotel A")

### Example: Durban Golden Mile Hotels

| Hotel | Tier | 2-Sleeper Weekday | 2-Sleeper Weekend |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SeaIMP Budget Apartments | Budget | R574 | R650 |
| Durban Beachfront Inn | Affordable | R1,200 | R1,400 |
| The Balmoral Hotel | Premium | R2,200 | R2,500 |

---

## Rate Management System

The RMS is an internal database-driven system that controls pricing independently of external APIs.

### Database Tables

```
areas              → Geographic zones (18 total across 6 destinations)
hotels             → Hotel properties linked to areas
room_types         → Room configurations per hotel
room_rates         → Base weekday/weekend rates per room type
seasonal_periods   → Multipliers for peak/off-peak seasons
rate_overrides     → Date-specific price overrides
rate_history       → Historical rate tracking
```

### Rate Calculation Flow

```
1. Check for date-specific override (rate_overrides table)
   ↓ If none found
2. Determine if weekend (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
   ↓
3. Get base rate (weekday or weekend) from room_rates
   ↓
4. Apply seasonal multiplier from seasonal_periods
   ↓
5. Return final rate: base_rate × multiplier
```

### Database Functions

```sql
-- Get rate for a specific room type on a specific date
get_room_rate(room_type_id, date) → Returns decimal

-- Get total cost for a stay (sums daily rates)
get_stay_cost(room_type_id, check_in, check_out) → Returns decimal
```

## Room Types & Capacities

### Capacity Categories

| Capacity | Label | Max Occupancy |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `2_sleeper` | 2-Sleeper | 2 adults + 0-1 children |
| `4_sleeper` | 4-Sleeper | 4 adults OR 2 adults + 2 children |

### Capacity Filtering Rules

- **Groups of 1-2 people**: Show only 2-sleeper options
- **Groups of 3+ people**: Show only 4-sleeper options
- **4-sleeper maximum**: 4 people total per room

### Special Room Variants

For Premium tier, specific 4-sleeper variants exist:
- Adults-only groups (4 adults)
- Family groups (2 adults + 2 children)
- Some include breakfast tracking

---

## Pricing Calculations

### Master Formula

```
Total Cost = Accommodation Cost + Package Cost + Service Fees
```

### Accommodation Cost Calculation

```
Accommodation Cost = Nightly Rate × Number of Nights × Number of Rooms
```

**Per-Room Method**: Hotelbeds rates are per-room, not total.
- 1 room @ R1,200/night = R1,200
- 2 rooms @ R1,200/night = R2,400

**4-Sleeper Rooms**: No surcharge applied. Use standard per-room rate.

### Per-Person Calculation (Multi-Room)

Costs are distributed based on **actual room occupancy**, not averaged:

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 room, 2 adults | Room cost ÷ 2 |
| 2 rooms, 2 adults each | Each room ÷ 2 (calculated separately) |
| 2 rooms, mixed (2+1 adults) | Double room ÷ 2, Single room ÷ 1 |
| 1 room (4-sleeper), 4 adults | Room cost ÷ 4 |

### Package Cost

```
Package Cost = Package Price Per Adult × Number of Adults
```

Package prices are defined in `src/data/activitiesData.ts` and vary by destination.

### Destination Starting Prices

Formula for "from R X per person" display:

```
(R700 budget accommodation × 2 nights) + (package cost × 2 adults) + (R1,700 service fees for 2)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                                              2 people
```

## Service Fees

### Standard Groups (1-24 people)

#### Adult Fees

| Adults | Fee Per Adult |
|--------|---------------|
| 1 | R1,000 |
| 2-3 | R850 |
| 4-9 | R800 |
| 10+ | R750 |

#### Child Fees

| Age Range | Fee | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| 0-2 years | FREE | |
| 3-12 years | R200 | |
| 13-17 years | R300 | |

**Special Rule**: Children aged 4-16 with only 1 adult pay R300 (not R150).

### Large Groups (25+ people)

| Quote Type | Adult Fee | Child 3-12 | Child 13-17 |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| LiveHotelQuoteCard | R550 | R100 | R200 |
| TravelAgentQuote | R400 | R100 | R200 |
| AccommodationProviderQuote | R400 | R100 | R200 |
| BusHireHotelCard | R400 | R100 | R200 |

### Display Rules

- Service fee breakdowns are **hidden** from all user-facing outputs
- Fees are calculated internally and added to total
- Only "Grand Total" is shown to clients

---

## Seasonal Pricing

### Multiplier System

Seasonal periods apply multipliers to base rates:

| Period | Typical Multiplier | Example Dates |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Low Season | 0.9x | May - August |
| Standard | 1.0x | Default |
| Peak Season | 1.25x | September - November |
| Christmas/New Year | 1.5x - 1.55x | December 15 - January 5 |
| Easter | 1.3x | Varies |

### Multiplier Application

```
Final Daily Rate = Base Rate × Seasonal Multiplier
```

Multiple multipliers on same date: **Highest multiplier wins**.
